## Docker

Make sure you are installed Docker and Docker compose. The full documentation for Hicore Server installation is available in the [guide](https://hicore.dev/installation/).

### Step 1: Clone Project

For deploying server you should first clone the repository from Github for doing this in the terminal window enter the command:

```bash
 git clone https://github.com/hicore/hicore.git
```

### Step 2: Create Docker Compose File

Create `docker-compose.yml` and put it in a project folder. You can see full [docker-compose](https://hicore.dev/installation/#step-2-change-docker-compose-file).

### Step 3: Run Docker Compose

After creating `docker-compose.yml`, you can simply build Docker container by using this command:

```bash
 docker-compose up --build
```

In this stage Docker starts creating container and then the server is ready to use and Hicore runs on your machine.
